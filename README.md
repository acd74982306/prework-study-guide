# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
    It is my first project with web developement. 
    This project is meant to be a sand-box to experiment with web development, 
    while also being a reference sheet of notes on code commands.
    Once deployed, it creates a "notebook" that can be accesed from any browser. - i think.
    I've learned some basic HTML to structure, CSS to style, and JS to add functionality in the process.
